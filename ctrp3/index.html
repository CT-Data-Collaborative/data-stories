                  ver the past fifteen years,
                </span>
                racial profiling has been recognized as an issue of national, state, and local importance. Members of the public have increasingly questioned whether police officers target individuals based on their race, ethnicity, age, gender or membership in a protected class. Nationally, disparities found in traffic stops have come under scrutiny by the public, policymakers, and civil rights groups.
              </p>
              <p>Minority groups have historically expressed lower levels of trust and confidence in law enforcement. Conversely, while acknowledging that 'bad actors' do exist, law enforcement often feel as though legitimate police work can be mistakenly perceived as bias, or even overt racism.</p>
              <p>In accordance with changes to the Alvin W. Penn Racial Profiling Prohibition Act (Public Act 99-198) made by the Connecticut General Assembly in 2012 and 2013, statewide data collection on traffic stops began on October 1, 2013. During the first year of data collection, data from approximately 595,000 traffic stops was recorded.</p>

              <p>The data collected by Connecticut is the most detailed and comprehensive of any other state in the county. The analysis of that data by the Institute for Municipal and Regional Policy at Central Connecticut State University is the most sophisticated effort conducted on a statewide basis for all local police departments.</p>
              <p>The intention of this data story is to walk you through the statistical analysis and provide you with a better understand of the following: </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Overview of the statewide analysis</li>
                <li>Explanation of the two statistical tests - Veil of Darkness and KPT Hit Rate</li>
                <li>The conclusions and next steps for continued analysis</li>
              </ol>
              <hr></hr>

                esearchers want to be able to test whether, holding other factors constant, the race and/or ethnicity of a motorist increases the probability that they are stopped by the police.
              </p>
              <p>Determining if profiling is taking place in a given department requires comparing stop activity against some reference data. A natural inclination would be to use the resident population of the town as a proxy for the driving population in order to compare the racial/ethnic composition of stopped motorists to the racial composition of the town BUT: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The population that lives in a town is different than the population that drives through a town;</li>
                <li>There are seasonal variations in driving patterns;</li>
                <li>Driving patterns change depending on the day of the week and also the time of day</li>
              </ul>
              <p>AND it is impossible to obtain detailed enough data about the demographic makeup of the driving population to make any inference.</p>
              <p>In a laboratory setting, randomized controlled experiments help scientists isolate cause and effect. The problem with creating a randomized control trial to test for racial bias in traffic stops is that it is both expensive and ethically troublesome. As a result, social scientists use research strategies that mimic the nature of a randomized control trail using  data that are available.</p>
              <hr></hr>
              <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>
              The veil of darkness test (developed by Grogger and Ridgeway in 2006) compares traffic stops during daylight and evening hours. If a police officer is inclined to profile they are only able to do so during the day when they can perceive the race and/or ethnicity of the driver before they make a stop. Therefore, darkness establishes a 'natural experiment' that can be used to mimic a randomized control study.</p>
              <p>For example, the researchers can look at stops occurring at 6pm in December—when it is dark outside—versus stops at 6pm in July—when it is light outside—and see if there is a statistical difference. (Night stops are the control group and day stops are the treatment group – this is an example of a natural experiment)</p>
              <p>Researchers wanted to compare times where the likelihood of the racial and ethnic driving population remained constant throughout the year. To do this they examined stops that occurred during the inter-twilight period.</p>

              <p>The inter-twighlight period is the time from dawn to dusk; 6pm during the winter is dark and 6pm during the summer is light, and in general the driving population should remain constant. Therefore, stops during these two time periods should be constant if no profiling is occurring. Removed twilight- this is the time of day when luminosity is transitioning from daylight to darkness.</p>
              <p>4 Police Departments identified with significant racial disparities. After looking at all departments, the five departments listed on the vertical axis were identified as having statistically significant racial bias.</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Granby</li>
                <li>Groton Town</li>
                <li>State Police Troop C</li>
                <li>State Police Troop H</li>
              </ol>
              <noapp>
                <aside class="note">
                  <p>Groton Town does include Groton City or Groton Long Point departments. Troop C covers towns around I-84 in Tolland County and Troop H covers most of Hartford County including Cromwell.</p>
                </aside>
              </noapp>
              <p>These departments were identified even with the following factors held constant:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>time of day (since traffic volume can vary with time)</li>
                <li>day of week (again weekday volume is different than weekend volume)</li>
                <li>daily volumetric measure of stops (to control for seasonal variation that might impact the proportion of minority drivers)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The town of Waterbury was also added to the list when the data collected from that department showed signs of a statistically significant disparity under a more restrictive specification. Specifically, researchers were concerned that vehicular equipment violations (like headlights) might create a bias in the test.  What do we mean by bias in the test? It means there exists a possibility that unobserved factors that were not controlled for in the model could be skewing the results. In an effort to check for this, the researchers excluded equipment violation traffic stops assuming police officers are pulling motorists over due to a violation and would conceivably not be profiling based on race/ethnicity. For example, if minorities are more likely to have equipment violations the results would show evidence of racial bias when in fact it might not exist.</p>
              <p>When these stops are removed, Waterbury shows racial disparity across several minority groups, however, the sample size is small so it will be interesting to see if a disparity persists as more data is collected.</p>
              <p>Zero means No Racial Disparities. Values > 0 provide evidence that racial bias does not exist. Values < 0 provides evidence that minority drivers are more likely to be stopped during the day. This disparity is evidence that could be an indication of racially biased policing. Coefficients are negative because you’re looking at the change in the likelihood that a minority driver is stopped during the day relative to their likelihood of being stopped at night. According to this hypothesis, researchers would expect to observe that the likelihood that a minority driver is stopped at night goes down if racial profiling were present.</p>
              <p>Sample size affects reliability. In statistical analysis, the larger the sample size, the better. This is due to the 'law of large numbers.' When a large number of random variables with the same mean are averaged together, the large values balance the small values and their sample average is close to their common mean. It is important to note that Granby has a small sample size so it will interesting to see if a disparity still persists as more traffic stop data are collected.</p>
              <p>Gray bar (represents the standard error) indicates that the TRUE coefficient could lie somewhere on the line. The circle size represents the sample size. As the sample size increases, the gray bar decreases and the confidence that the TRUE value of the coefficient was found.</p>
              <hr></hr>
              <p>
                <span class="dropcap">T</span>
                he second statistical test that was conducted was an analysis of post-stop data – the KPT Hit Rate. The test calculates the probability of a stop resulting in a hit (finding contraband) across different racial groups.
              </p>
              <p>The KPT Hit Rate (developed by Knowles, Persico, and Todd in 2001) model assumes that in conducting vehicular searches, police maximize the likelihood of successfully finding contraband while drivers minimize their risk of getting caught. If motorists believe that they are more or less likely to be searched, they are assumed to change their behavior accordingly (carry contraband less or more frequently). </p>
              <p>The KPT Hit Rate model is a more controversial test. Critics take issue that it does not reflect the full range of possible discriminatory behavior by police officers such as the length of time drivers are subject to searches. In addition, researchers were unable to estimate the effect for many departments since the sample size was too small. More stops produce a more robust finding when running this analysis. As more traffic stop data is collected it will be important to rerun this test. One year of traffic stop data did not produce large enough sample sizes for majority of the departments in the state.</p>
              <p>For most departments, points cluster around the expected equilibrium. However, five departments were identified as having a statistically significant disparity in the hit rate of minority groups relative to their nonminority counterparts. The five departments identified in the report were observed to have a statistically significant disparity in the rate at which minority motorists were dutifully searched when compared to Caucasians.  Although more departments than these five were observed as having statistically significant disparities, they were not shown because the disparity only existed in one or two minority definitions (i.e. only for Hispanic or Black alone) and not across multiple categories. The five departments identified in the analysis showed statistically significant disparities across multiple racial and demographic groups. </p>

              <table></table>
              <ul>
                <li>West Hartford has a disparity in the hit rate for Hispanic motorists that is driving the remainder of the results</li>
                <li>State Police Troop I is being driven by the hit rate for Black motorists</li>
                <li>State Police Troop C, F and Waterbury have a statistically significant disparity in the hit rate across all demographic groups. Should be noted that Waterbury has a small sample size so it will interesting to see if results persist as the sample size grows. However, the results in this analysis are significant at the 99% level.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The End. The statistical evaluation of policing data is an important step towards developing a transparent dialogue between law enforcement and the public at large. The next step in the research is to determine if individual officers are driving departmental disparities by looking at officer level data.</p>
