Members of the public have increasingly questioned whether police officers target individuals based on their race, ethnicity, age, gender or membership in a protected class. Nationally, disparities found in traffic stops have come under scrutiny by the public, policymakers, and civil rights groups. Large disparities found in traffic enforcement have been long criticized by minority groups as unfair. As a results of this evolution of public consciousness, law enforcement agencies face an increased level of scrutiny from the public.","Minority groups have historically expressed lower levels of trust and confidence in law enforcement. Conversely, although acknowledging that 'bad actors' do exist, law enforcement often feel as though legitimate police work can be mistakenly perceived as bias, or even overt racism.",,,,,showIntro13,Legislative action in Connecticut,,"In accordance with changes to the Alvin W. Penn Racial Profiling Prohibition Act (Public Act 99-198) made by the Connecticut General Assembly in 2012 and 2013, widespread traffic stop data collection began on October 1, 2013. ","Interpreting data collected during traffic stops is not straightforward. Comparing traffic stop data from one department to others or to statewide averages can be misleading. Differences in the populations traveling through parts of the state patrolled by different departments create significant difficulties in generating accurate estimates. These limitations have been recognized and addressed by the community of researchers who study racial and ethnic disparities in policing. This data story will walk through the tests and findings used to examine the most recently released traffic stop data in Connecticut.",,,,,showIntro24,Analytic Approach,,"Researchers want to be able to infer that one variable (such as race or ethnicity) has a causal effect on another variable (probability of being stopped by the police). Researchers often use statistical or econometric techniques to explore and test for causal relationships.","In much scientific research, scientists can set up controlled experiments -- having a control and treatment group-- in order to isolate cause and effect. However, for many ""real world"" research questions, it is often difficult, prohibitively expensive, or morally repugnant to conduct such experiments. Econometrics uses statistical techniques to test available data in ways that can simulate controlled, laboratory experiments. For the Racial Profiling Prohibition Study, two econometric test were used: The KPT Hit Rate and the Veil of Darkness. (Make a different color)",,,,,showAnalysis5,KPT Hit Rate,Assumption,"If police officers are not biased, then police officers make the decision to search cars in an effort to maximize their expectations of finding contraband.","Since motorists know police officers will search in an effort to maximize their expectations of finding contraband, they will alter their contraband-carrying strategy accordingly.",,,,,showKPTExplain16,KPT Hit Rate,Strategy,"If motorists believe that they belong to a population subgroup that police are biased towards, Since motorists know police officers will search in an effort to maximize their expectations of finding contraband, they will alter their contraband-carrying strategy accordingly.",,,,,,showKPTExplain27,KPT Hit Rate Results by Town in CT,,,,"X-axis shows caucasian, Y-axis shows minority hit rate",,,,addPoints8,KPT Hit Rate Results by Town in CT,,,,This line shows equilibrium (e.g. convergence between the hit rate for the compared groups indicating a lack of bias).,Points above show the potential for racial bias.

Darkness establishes a 'natural experiment' that can be used to mimic a randomized control study.","The veil of darkness test is a multiple regression analysis that produces, as an output, an indicator of how different variables affect the odds ratio of being stopped during the day vs. at night.",,,,showVODExplain14,Veil of Darkness - Results,5 Police Departments identified with significant racial disparities,,,,,,,revealPointsVOD15,Veil of Darkness,Zero means No Racial Profling Disparities,,,,,,,movePointsVOD16,Veil of Darkness,,,,A negative value indicates the presence of racial profiling; the probability of being stopped decreases at night when the police officer cannot determine race pre-stop.,,,,sizePointsVOD17,Veil of Darkness,,"Gray bar (represents the standard error) indicates that the TRUE coefficient could like somewhere on the line.The circle size represents the sample size.As the sample size increases, the gray bar decreases and the significance increases that the TRUE value of the coefficient was found.",,"In regression analysis, the larger the sample size, the better. This is due to the 'law of large numbers.' When a large number of random variables with the same mean are averaged together, the large values balance the small values and their sample average is close to their common mean.",,,,addErrorBarsVOD
