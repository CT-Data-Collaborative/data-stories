Darkness establishes a 'natural experiment' that can be used to mimic a randomized control study.",,,,Racial profiling sends the dehumanizing message to our citizens that they are judged by the color of their skin and harms the criminal justice system by eviscerating the trust that is necessary if law enforcement is to effectively protect our communities.,"US Department of Justice, June 17, 2003",,,1,revealPointsVOD,Veil of Darkness,Zero means No Racial Profling Disparities,The regression looks at the change in the odds ratio - the change in the likelihood a racial minority is stopped during the day versus the night.,The coefficient represents the difference between two probabilities:,<ol><li>the probability of a minority driver being stopped during the day versus a white driver being stopped at night</li><li>the probability of a white driver being stopped during the day versus a minority driver being stopped at night</li></ol>,"When racial bias exists, Probability #1 is >1 and Probability #2 is 1 or close to 1 and the change is negative",,,,,,,2,movePointsVOD,Veil of Darkness,5 Police Departments identified with significant racial disparities,The five towns listed on the y-axis were identified as having statistically significant racial bias,These towns were identified even with the following factors held constant:,<ul><li>time of day (since amount of cars varies)</li><li>day of week (again weekday volume is different than weekend volume)</li><li>daily volumetric measure of stops (to control for seasonal variation that might impact the proportion of minority drivers)</li></ul>,,,,,,,,3,addErrorBarsVOD,Veil of Darkness,,"In regression analysis, the larger the sample size, the better. This is due to the 'law of large numbers.' When a large number of random variables with the same mean are averaged together, the large values balance the small values and their sample average is close to their common mean.",Gray bar (represents the standard error) indicates that the TRUE coefficient could lie somewhere on the line.,The circle size represents the sample size.,"As the sample size increases, the gray bar decreases and the significance increases that the TRUE value of the coefficient was found.",,,,,,,4,showCartoon,KPT Hit Rate,,"The KPT Hit Rate is a ratio expressing how often contraband is found during consensual searches(equipment violation stops were excluded from the analysis). The primary assumption is that officers seek to maximize finding contraband, while contraband carriers seek to minimize being caught.","If motorists believe that they are more or less likely to be searched, they are assumed to change their behavior accordingly (carry contraband less or more frequently). This is a classic example of an economic game. The KPT Hit Rate analysis uses Game Theory techniques to look for biased behavior.",A statistical test compares traffic stop data with what we the hypothesis. The test calculates the probability of a stop resulting in a hit across different racial groups. The results are plotted here.,,,,,,,,5,showKPTTowns,KPT Hit Rate,,,,,,,,,,,,6,addPoints,KPT Hit Rate,Are the deviations from the observed data and expected data the result of chance (random) or are differences due to other factors (e.g. racial profiling)?,,,,,,,,,,,7,addBisect,KPT Hit Rate,Are the deviations from the observed data and expected data the result of chance (random) or are differences due to other factors (e.g. racial profiling)?,The X and Y coordinate of a point represent the proportion of stops results in contraband being found (e.g. hits) by race/ethnicity subgroup for each department in the state.,The dotted line expresses the hypotheis that hit rates across groups will be the same.,Points above show the potential for racial bias. Points below show little to no evidence of racial bias.,,,,,,,,8,colorPointsRace,KPT Hit Rate,,"For most departments, points cluster around the expected equilibrium.","Mouse over each point to see the calculated hit rate, the sample size and the p-value.",The p-value is the probability that what is observed is not due to chance. A small p-value gives researchers a higher level of confidence that racial bias is attributing to the differences from observed versus expected results.,,,,,,,,9,opacityPointsSignificant,KPT Hit Rate,,"When we eliminate those departments / subgroup combinations whose p-value is not statistically significant, we are left with a much smaller subset of departments where racial bias may be taking place.","However, p-value is not the only relevent data point to consider. ",The number of stops taking place strongly influences the reliability of the test. More stops produce a more robust finding when running this analysis.,,,,,,,,10,sizePoints,KPT Hit Rate,Police Departments with Hit Rates that were Significantly Higher than Expected Value,"When we size points by the sample size, we can see which findings are more likely to be useful in exploring the presence of racial bias.",Eliminating all data points where the sample size was less than 125 gives us a much clearer picture. The following departments are displayed:,"<ul><li>Middletown</li><li>Milford</li><li>New Haven</li><li>Norwich</li><li>State Police Troops A,C,E, & L</li><li>West Hartford</li><li>Willimantic</li><ul>",As more data is collected it will be important to rerun the KPT Hit Rate analysis.,,,,,,,11,showConclusion,,,,,,,,,"We'd like to thank all those who helped refine, edit, and compose this data story:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
