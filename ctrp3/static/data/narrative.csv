As public consciousness has been raised, law enforcement agencies face an increased level of scrutiny from the public.",,,,Racial profiling sends the dehumanizing message to our citizens that they are judged by the color of their skin and harms the criminal justice system by eviscerating the trust that is necessary if law enforcement is to effectively protect our communities.,"US Department of Justice, June 17, 2003",,,1,showIntro1,,,"Minority groups have historically expressed lower levels of trust and confidence in law enforcement. Conversely, while acknowledging that 'bad actors' do exist, law enforcement often feel as though legitimate police work can be mistakenly perceived as bias, or even overt racism.","In accordance with changes to the Alvin W. Penn Racial Profiling Prohibition Act (Public Act 99-198) made by the Connecticut General Assembly in 2012 and 2013, widespread traffic stop data collection began on October 1, 2013.",Connecticut is the first state to collect and examine traffic stop data on a stawide basis; including all departments in the state,,,,,,,,2,showIntro2,Exploring the Data,,"During the first year of data collection, data from X traffic stops was recorded. A natural instinct would be to compare the driving population to the racial composition of the town BUT:","<ol class=""slidelist""><li>The population that lives in a town is different than the population that drives through a town</li><li>There are seasonal variations in driving patterns</li></ol>",Researchers want to be able to infer that one variable (such as the race or ethnicity of the motorist) has a causal effect on another variable (probability of being stopped by the police).,"In much scientific research, scientists can set up controlled experiments &#8212; having a control and treatment group &#8212; in order to isolate cause and effect.","However, for many ""real world"" research questions, it is often difficult, prohibitively expensive, or morally repugnant to conduct such experiments.",,,,,,3,showInterpretationProblems,,,The power of multiple regression analysis is that it allows us to do in non-experimental environments what natural scientists are able to do in a controlled laboratory setting: keep other factors fixed.,"For the Racial Profiling Prohibition Study, two statistical tests were used: <span class=""tests"">KPT Hit Rate</span> and the <span class=""tests"">Veil of Darkness<span>",This data story will walk through the findings from applying these two tests to the most recently released traffic stop data in Connecticut.,,,,,,,,4,addPoints,KPT Hit Rate,Are the deviations from the observed data and expected data the result of chance (random) or are differences due to other factors (e.g. racial profiling)?,"The KPT Hit Rate is a ratio expressesing how often contraband is found during consensual searches. The primary assumption is that officers seek to maximize finding contraband, while contraband carriers seek to minimize being caught.","If motorists believes that they are more or less likely to be searched, they are assumed to change their behavior accordingly (carry contraband less or more frequentally). This is a classic example of an economic game. The KPT Hit Rate analysis uses Game Theory techniques to look for biased behavior.",The hypothesis is that the behavior adjustments made by all actors will result in the liklihood of an officer finding contrband being no different across different subgroups.,A statistical test compares traffic stop data with what we the hypothesis. The test calculates the probability of a stop resulting in a hit across different racial groups. The results are plotted here.,,,,,,,5,addBisect,KPT Hit Rate,Are the deviations from the observed data and expected data the result of chance (random) or are differences due to other factors (e.g. racial profiling)?,The X and Y coordinate of a point represent the proportion of stops results in contraband being found (e.g. hits) by race/ethnicity subgroup for each department in the state.,The dotted line expresses the hypotheis that hit rates across groups will be the same.,Points above show the potential for racial bias. Points below show little to no evidence of racial bias.,,,,,,,,6,colorPointsRace,KPT Hit Rate,,"For most departments, points cluster around the expected equilibirum.","Mouse over each point to see the calculated hit rate, the sample size and the p-value.",The p-value expresses the results of the chi-square test that is the basis of the the KPT Hit Rate analysis.,P-value expresses: X,,,,,,,7,opacityPointsSignificant,KPT Hit Rate,,"When we eliminate those departments / subgroup combinations whose p-value is too large, we are left with a much smaller subset of departments where profiling may be taking place.","However, p-value is not the only relevent data point to consider. ",The number of stops taking place strongly influences the reliability of the test. More stops produce a more robust finding when running this analyis.,,,,,,,,8,sizePoints,KPT Hit Rate,Police Departments with Hit Rates that were Significantly Higher than Expected Value,"When we size points by the sample size, we can see which findings are more likely to be useful in exploring the presence of racial bias.",Eliminating all data points where the sample size was less than 125 gives us a much clearer picture. The following departments are displayed:,"<ul><li>Middletown</li><li>Milford</li><li>New Haven</li><li>Norwich</li><li>State Police Troops A,C,E, & L</li><li>West Hartford</li><li>Willimantic</li><ul>",As more data is collected it will be important to rerun the KPT Hit Rate analysis.,"Now, on to the Veil of Darkness results.",,,,,,9,showVODExplain,Veil of Darkness,,"The veil of darkness test is a multiple regression analysis that produces, as an output, an indicator of how different variables affect the odds ratio of being stopped during the day vs. at night.","Hypothesis: If police officers are profiling motorists, they would be more likely to do so during daylight hours when race and ethnicity are more easily discernible.","If racial bias is not present in traffic stops, the probability of minorities and non-minorities being stopped during the day should not be statistically different than stops during the night. Darkness establishes a 'natural experiment' that can be used to mimic a randomized control study.",,,,,,,,10,revealPointsVOD,Veil of Darkness,5 Police Departments identified with significant racial disparities,Coefficients are negative because you're looking at the change in the odds ratio of being stopped during the day versus the night.,"When racial profiling exists, the difference goes down; a minority drivers probability of being stopped decreases when comparing day to night.",,,,,,,,,11,movePointsVOD,Veil of Darkness,Zero means No Racial Profling Disparities,,,,,,,,,,,12,sizePointsVOD,Veil of Darkness,,,,,,,,,,,,13,addErrorBarsVOD,Veil of Darkness,,"In regression analysis, the larger the sample size, the better. This is due to the 'law of large numbers.' When a large number of random variables with the same mean are averaged together, the large values balance the small values and their sample average is close to their common mean.","Gray bar (represents the standard error) indicates that the TRUE coefficient could like somewhere on the line.The circle size represents the sample size.As the sample size increases, the gray bar decreases and the significance increases that the TRUE value of the coefficient was found.",,,,,,,,,14,showConclusion,,,,,,,,,"We'd like to thank all those who helped refine, edit, and compose this data story:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
