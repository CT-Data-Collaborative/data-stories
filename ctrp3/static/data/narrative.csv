As public consciousness has raised, law enforcement agencies face an increased level of scrutiny from the public.","Minority groups have historically expressed lower levels of trust and confidence in law enforcement. Conversely, although acknowledging that 'bad actors' do exist, law enforcement often feel as though legitimate police work can be mistakenly perceived as bias, or even overt racism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,showIntro2,Legislative action in Connecticut,,"In accordance with changes to the Alvin W. Penn Racial Profiling Prohibition Act (Public Act 99-198) made by the Connecticut General Assembly in 2012 and 2013, widespread traffic stop data collection began on October 1, 2013.",Connecticut is the first state to collect and examine traffic stop data on a stawide basis; including all departments in the state,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,showInterpretationProblems,Why intrepretation of data can be misleading,,A natural instinct would be to compare the driving population to the racial composition of the town BUT,"<ol class=""slidelist""><li>The population that lives in a town is different than the population that drives through a town</li><li>There are seasonal variations in driving patterns</li></ol>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,showAnalysis,Analytic Approach for studying Traffic Stop Data in CT,Econometric Analysis looks at variables/factors that might be causing an effect,Researchers want to be able to infer that one variable (such as race or ethnicity) has a causal effect on another variable (probability of being stopped by the police).,"In much scientific research, scientists can set up controlled experiments &#8212; having a control and treatment group &#8212; in order to isolate cause and effect.","However, for many ""real world"" research questions, it is often difficult, prohibitively expensive, or morally repugnant to conduct such experiments.",The power of multiple regression analysis is that it allows us to do in non-experimental environments what natural scientists are able to do in a controlled laboratory setting: keep other factors fixed,"For the Racial Profiling Prohibition Study, two econometric test were used: <span class=""tests"">KPT Hit Rate</span> and the <span class=""tests"">Veil of Darkness<span>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,showMethodology,Methodology,Two Approaches: KPT Hit Rate & Veil of Darkness,"KPT Hit Rate: <ul><li>Hit Rate = # of times contraband found/# of times cars searched</li><li>Question: Are the observed rates different than the expected rates?</li><li>Hypothesis: If racial bias didn't exist, the rate of contraband found relative to the total number of searches across motorist groups would be equal</li><li>White is the control group and minorities are the treatment</li><li>The statistical test calculates the probability of a stop resulting in a hit across different racial grroups</li></ul>","Veil of Darkness: <ul class=slidelist""><li>Hypothesis: if police officers are profiling motorists, they would be more likely to do so during daylight hours when race and ethnicity are more easily discernible</li><li>If racial bias is not present in traffic stops, the probability of minorities and non-minorities being stopped during the day should not be statistically different than stops during the night.</li><li>Establishes a 'natural experiment' meaning it creates a treatment and control group in an effort to mimic a randomized control setting</li></ul>",This data story will walk through the tests used to examine the most recently released traffic stop data in Connecticut and their findings.,,,The statistical tests that were performed - hypothesis and caluclations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,addPoints,KPT Hit Rate Results by Town in CT,Are the deviations from the observed data and expected data the result of chance (random) or are differences due to other factors (e.g. racial profiling)?,,,,,,"Chi-Square Test: Statistical test used to compare observed data with what we would expect to obtain according to a pre-determined hypothesis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,addBisect,KPT Hit Rate Results by Town in CT,,,,,,,The dotted line shows equilibrium (e.g. convergence between the hit rate for the compared groups indicating a lack of bias).,Points above show the potential for racial bias.

This is due to the 'law of large numbers.' When a large number of random variables with the same mean are averaged together, the large values balance the small values and their sample average is close to their common mean.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,17,showConclusion,Thank You,,"We'd like to thank all those who helped refine, edit, and compose this data story:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
