A natural instinct would be to compare the driving population to the racial composition of the town BUT:,<ol><li>The population that lives in a town is different than the population that drives through a town; and</li><li>There are seasonal variations in driving patterns</li></ol>,"Controlled experiments help scientists isolate cause and effect but in the ""real world"" it is often difficult to conduct such experiments.","Statistical methods, including multiple regression, allow researchers to do in non-experimental environments what natural scientists are able to do in a controlled laboratory setting: keep other factors fixed.",Scroll down to learn about the Veil of Darkness and KPT Hit Rate.,,,,,,1,showVODExplain,Veil of Darkness,,The veil of darkness test compares traffic stops during daylight and evening hours.,"If police officers are profiling motorists, they would be more likely to do so during daylight hours when race and ethnicity are more easily discernible.","Therefore, darkness establishes a 'natural experiment' that can be used to mimic a randomized control study.",,,,Racial profiling sends the dehumanizing message to our citizens that they are judged by the color of their skin and harms the criminal justice system by eviscerating the trust that is necessary if law enforcement is to effectively protect our communities.,"US Department of Justice, June 17, 2003",,,2,revealPointsVOD,Veil of Darkness,Zero means No Racial Profiling Disparities,Values > 0 provide evidence that racial bias doesn't exist,Values < 0 provide evidence of racial bias,The coefficient on the x-axis looks at the marginal difference between:,<ol><li>the probability of a minority driver being stopped during the day versus a white driver being stopped at night</li><li>the probability of a white driver being stopped during the day versus a minority driver being stopped at night</li></ol>,,,,,,,3,movePointsVOD,Veil of Darkness,5 Police Departments identified with significant racial disparities,The five departments listed on the y-axis were identified as having statistically significant racial bias.<sup>1</sup>,These departments were identified even with the following factors held constant:,<ul><li>time of day (since amount of cars varies)</li><li>day of week (again weekday volume is different than weekend volume)</li><li>daily volumetric measure of stops (to control for seasonal variation that might impact the proportion of minority drivers)</li></ul>,<hr><sub>1. Groton Town does include Groton City or Groton Long Point departments. Troop C covers towns around I-84 in Tolland County and Troop H covers most of Hartford County including Cromwell.</sub>,,,,,,,4,addErrorBarsVOD,Veil of Darkness,Sample size affects reliability,"In regression analysis, the larger the sample size, the better. This is due to the 'law of large numbers.' When a large number of random variables with the same mean are averaged together, the large values balance the small values and their sample average is close to their common mean.",Gray bar (represents the standard error) indicates that the TRUE coefficient could lie somewhere on the line.,The circle size represents the sample size.,"As the sample size increases, the gray bar decreases and the confidence that the TRUE value of the coefficient was found.",,,,,,,5,showCartoon,KPT Hit Rate,,"The KPT Hit Rate model assumes that in patrolling, police maximize the likelihood of success in finding contraband while drivers minimize their risk of getting caught.","If motorists believe that they are more or less likely to be searched, they are assumed to change their behavior accordingly (carry contraband less or more frequently). ",The test calculates the probability of a stop resulting in a hit (finding contraband) across different racial groups.,The KPT Hit Rate model is a more controversial test. Critics take issue that it does not reflect the full range of possible discriminatory behavior by police officers such as the length of time drivers are subject to searches.,,,,,,,6,showKPTTowns,KPT Hit Rate,,,,,,,,,,,,7,addPoints,KPT Hit Rate,Are the deviations from the observed data and expected data the result of chance (random) or are differences due to other factors (e.g. racial profiling)?,The X and Y coordinate of a point represent the proportion of stops resulting in contraband being found (e.g. hits) by race/ethnicity subgroup for each department in the state.,The dotted line expresses the hypothesis that hit rates across groups will be the same.,Points above show the potential for racial bias. Points below show little to no evidence of racial bias.,,,,,,,,8,colorPointsRace,KPT Hit Rate,,"For most departments, points cluster around the expected equilibrium.","Mouse over each point to see the calculated hit rate, the sample size and the p-value.",The p-value is the probability that what is observed is not due to chance. A small p-value gives researchers a higher level of confidence that racial bias is attributing to the differences from observed versus expected results.,,,,,,,,9,opacityPointsSignificant,KPT Hit Rate,,"When we eliminate those departments / subgroup combinations whose p-value is not statistically significant, we are left with a much smaller subset of departments where racial bias may be taking place.","However, p-value is not the only relevant data point to consider.",The number of stops taking place strongly influences the reliability of the test. More stops produce a more robust finding when running this analysis.,,,,,,,,10,sizePoints,KPT Hit Rate,Police Departments with Hit Rates that were Significantly Higher than Expected Value,"When we size points by the sample size, we can see which findings are more likely to be useful in exploring the presence of racial bias.",Eliminating all data points where the sample size was less than 125 gives us a much clearer picture. The following departments are displayed:,"<ul><li>Middletown</li><li>Milford</li><li>New Haven</li><li>Norwich</li><li>State Police Troops A,C,E, & L</li><li>West Hartford</li><li>Willimantic</li><ul>",It will be important to rerun this test as more data is collected. One year of traffic stop data did not produce large enough sample sizes for majority of the departments in the state.,,,,,,,11,showConclusion,The End,,The statistical evaluation of policing data is an important step towards developing a transparent dialogue between law enforcement and the public at large.,The next step in the research is to determine if individual officers are driving departmental disparities by looking at officer level data.,,,,,"Produced and created by: The CT Data Collaborative staff - Sasha Cuerda, Michelle Riordan-Nold, Brendan Swiniarski","Thank you to all those who helped refine, edit, and compose this data story.",,,
