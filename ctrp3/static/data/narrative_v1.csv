Members of the public have increasingly questioned whether police officers target individuals based on their race, ethnicity, age, gender or membership in a protected class. Nationally, disparities found in traffic stops have come under scrutiny by the public, policymakers, and civil rights groups. Large disparities found in traffic enforcement have been long criticized by minority groups as unfair. As a results of this evolution of public consciousness, law enforcement agencies face an increased level of scrutiny from the public.","Minority groups have historically expressed lower levels of trust and confidence in law enforcement. Conversely, although acknowledging that 'bad actors' do exist, law enforcement often feel as though legitimate police work can be mistakenly perceived as bias, or even overt racism.",,,,3,Exploring Connecticut Traffic Stop Data,,"In accordance with changes to the Alvin W. Penn Racial Profiling Prohibition Act (Public Act 99-198) made by the Connecticut General Assembly in 2012 and 2013, widespread traffic stop data collection began on October 1, 2013. Amongst other observations, officers recorded the perceived race of the driver for all traffic stops. ",Interpreting data collected during traffic stops is not straight forward. Comparing traffic stop data from one department to others or to statewide averages can be misleading. Differences in the populations traveling through parts of the state patrolled by different departments create significant difficulties in generating accurate estimates. These limitations have been recognized and addressed by the community of researchers who study racial and ethnic disparities in policing. This data story will walk through the tests and findings used to examine the most recently released traffic stop data in Connecticut.,,,,4,History of Analytic Approaches,,"In the context of traffic stop analysis, researchers want to be able to infer that one variable (such as race or ethnicity) has a causal effect on another variable (probability of being stopped by the police). Comparing proportions of stops and stop outcomes for populations subgroups across departments, while tempting, fails to account for the numerous differences between departments that might also be influencing stop outcomes. To address these limitations, researchers often use statistical or econometric techniques to explore and test for causual relationships. ","In much scientific research, scientists set up controlled experiments in order to isolate cause and effect. However, for many ""real world"" research questions, it is often difficult, prohibitiely expensive, or morally repugnant to conduct such experiments. Econometrics uses statistical techniques to test available data in ways that can simulate controlled, laboratory experiments. In this research, two econometric test were used: The KPT Hit Rate and the Veil of Darkness.",,,,5,KPT Hit Rate,,"Assumption: If police officers are not biased, then police officers make the decision to search cars in an effort to maximize their expectations of finding contraband. ","The assumption behind this test comes from game theory. Game theory is the science of strategy. It attempts to determine mathematically the actions ""agents"" or ""people"" will take to secure the best outcomes for themselves. What's critical is that the outcome for each ""agent"" depends on the choices made by all ""agents.""",,,,6,KPT Hit Rate,,,,"Since motorists know police officers will search in an effort to maximize their expectations of finding contraband, they will alter their contraband-carrying strategy accordingly.",,,7,KPT Hit Rate,,,,"In other words, if motorists believe that they belong to a population subgroup that police are biased towards, they will carry contraband less frequentally. In the absence of bias, the ""hit rate"" or proportion of stops yielding contraband, will be the same across population subgroups.",,,8,Veil of Darkness,,"Hypothesis: If police officers are profiling motorists, they would be more likely to do so during daylight hours when race and ethnicity are more easily discernible.","If racial bias is not present in traffic stops, the probability of minorities and non-minorities being stopped during the day should not be statistically different than stops during the night. Darkness establishes a 'natural experiment' that can be used to mimic a randomized control study. ",,,,9,KPT Hit Rate,,,,"Hit Rate by Town. X-axis shows caucasian, Y-axis shows minority hit rate",,,10,KPT Hit Rate,,,,This line shows equalibrium (e.g. convergence between the hit rate for the compared groups indicating a lack of bias).,Points above show X. Points below show Y.,,11,KPT Hit Rate,,,,,,,12,KPT Hit Rate,,,,A Chi-square test was used to evaluate the outcomes. ,"Determines if the deviations from the observed data and expected data were the result of chance (random) or are the differences due to some other factors (for example, racial profiling)",,13,KPT Hit Rate,,,,Ns Matter. The small sample size limits the usefulness of this test. ,As more data is collected it will be important to rerun the KPT Hit Rate analysis.,,14,Transition,,,,,,,15,Veil of Darkness,,,,"The veil of darkness test is a multiple regression analysis that produces, as an output, an indicator of how different variables affect the odds ratio of being stopped during the day vs. at night.",Why these towns?,,16,Veil of Darkness,,,,,,,17,Veil of Darkness,,,,A negative value indicates the presence of racial profiling; the probability of being stopped decreases at night when the police officer cannot determine race pre-stop.,,,18,Veil of Darkness,,,,,,,19,Veil of Darkness,,,,"In regression analysis, the larger the sample size, the better. This is due to the 'law of large numbers.' When a large number of random variables with the same mean are averaged together, the large values balance the small values and their sample average is close to their common mean. ",,,
